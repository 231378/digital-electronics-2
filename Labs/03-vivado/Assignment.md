### Preparation tasks

1. Figure or table with connection of 16 slide switches and 16 LEDs on Nexys A7 board:

### Two-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer

1. Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of mux_2bit_4to1 is
begin
    -- WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
end architecture Behavioral;
```

2. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`tb_mux_2bit_4to1`) with syntax highlighting and asserts. Verify at least five random input combinations:

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        -- WRITE YOUR TEST CASES HERE

        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```

3. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms; always display all inputs and outputs (inputs first):
