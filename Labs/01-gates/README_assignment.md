### De Morgan's laws

1. Equations of all three versions of logic function f(c,b,a):

![Logic function](Images/equations.png)

2. Completed table with logic functions' values:

| **c** | **b** |**a** | **f(c,b,a)** | **f_NAND(c,b,a)** | **f_NOR(c,b,a)** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  |  |  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  |  |  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |

3. Listing of VHDL architecture from design file (`design.vhd`) with syntax highlighting for all three functions:

```vhdl
architecture dataflow of demorgan is
begin

    -- WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

end architecture dataflow;
```

4. Link to your public EDA Playground example:

### Distributive laws

1. Listing of VHDL architecture from design file (`design.vhd`) with syntax highlighting for first or second distributive law:

```vhdl
architecture dataflow of distributive is
begin

    -- WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

end architecture dataflow;
```
